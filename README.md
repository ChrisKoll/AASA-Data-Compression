# File Compression/Decompression

This repository contains two Python files that implement a simple compression and decompression algorithm for files.
This project was created as part of the Advanced Algorithms of Sequence Analysis (AASA) lecture at the Goethe University Franfkurt am Main.

Files Included:
1. encode.py: This file contains the implementation of the compression algorithm. It reads input files, compresses their contents, and saves the compressed data to a new file.
2. decode.py: This file provides the implementation of the decompression algorithm. It takes compressed files, restores their original contents, and writes the decompressed data back to a new file.

These scripts are designed to demonstrate the principles of file compression and decompression, offering a straightforward example of how data can be efficiently encoded and decoded.
